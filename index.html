      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Technology Innovation Management (TIM) master's student at Carleton University and serve as a TIM ambassador. With over eight years of experience across supply chain management, research & development and business development, I have worked in the UK, Hong Kong, the USA and Canada. My entrepreneurial journey includes founding <em>EasyFlex Activewear</em>, a brand dedicated to accessible and comfortable clothing. Currently, I work in SaaS consulting and explore large language models, retrieval‑augmented generation and intelligent agents.</p>
      <p>I recently received the 2024 Nicol Internship Award and represent graduate students on Carleton’s Graduate Students’ Association council. I'm passionate about leveraging AI to drive innovation in business and the fashion industry.</p>
